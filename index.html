            <h2>Week 1 | Creating a Plan</h2>

            <p>The first week of my independent study started off with excitement and worry. I was excited to have time to continue working on Find My COVID Test, 
                but was also overwhelmed with the tasks of growing and building the project to gain traction.</p>
            <!-- <p>During the first week, I brainstormed solutions of improving the database of testing locations to include more locations.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, I planned on conducting a new round of usability testing to find ways of improving the website.</p>
            <p>I created a contact list of various state and county officials to email to help publicize or get the attention of to promote Find My COVID Test.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I created an outreach template that I would use to send emails and LinkedIn messages with. </p> -->

            <h3>I had 3 main goals for this independent study:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increase website traction</li>
                <li>Increase the amount of testing locations</li>
                <li>Increase social media engagement</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Week 2 | Outreach + Database</h2>

            <p>Like Google Maps, I made the URL change based on the userâ€™s search query. Additionally, I updated the COVID testing database to include more available locations users could register at. </p>

            <p>I began sending emails to San Mateo and Yolo County officials to inform them of my website in hopes of partnering and publicizing.</p>
            
            <p>Initially, I had intended to conduct user testing to get feedback on the current website, but realized that gaining traction was more important for the growth and development on the website. </p>

            <h2>Week 3 | Email Outreach + Social Media</h2>

            <p>Slower than before, I continued to update the COVID location database and continue my outreach, I continued emailing and sending countless LinkedIn invitations from COVID testing organizations such as Verily- Project Baseline, CVS Health, LHI, and Rite Aid.</p>

            <p>To gain the attention of people outside of my circle, I posted on LinkedIn and Facebook groups sharing the website and asking for connections in COVID-19 testing organizations</p>

            <h2>Week 4 | Newspaper Interview</h2>

            <p>Reflecting back on this quarter, Week 4 is when Find My COVID Test truly grew and the traction began to grow.</p> 

            <p>The excitement begins as Jeffrey Day, a content strategist and writer for the College of Letters and Science, interviewed me and wrote an 
                <a href = "https://lettersandscience.ucdavis.edu/blog/design-students-interactive-map-links-public-covid-19-testing-sites" target="_blank">article about Find My COVID Test</a> This helped gain the attention of more students on campus and continued to help publicize the website.</p>
                
            <p>Lastly, I entered the 2021 <a href = "https://designawards.core77.com/" target="_blank">CORE77 Design Awards competition</a>.</p>

            <h2>Week 5 | Verily + Curative CEO Connections</h2>

            <p>Like the weeks before, I continued to reach out to employees at testing organizations. 
                Excitingly, I connected with the founders of Verily and Curative on LinkedIn.
            </p>
            
            <p>Continuing to see how the power of social media could help promote Find My COVID Test, I directly reached out 
                to San Mateo County to see if they'd want to partner on Twitter. </p>

            <p>Additionally, I reached out to UC Davisâ€™s Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD) senate members about who at UC Davis would be good to 
                contact about promoting and getting the attention of the Chancellor. </p>

            <h2>Week 6 | Newspaper Interview + News Reporter Demo</h2>

            <p>The following week, I would soon get a response from ASUCD and received word that they would like to promote Find My COVID Test.</p>
            
            <p>I was also interviewed by the <a href = "https://theaggie.org/">California Aggie</a>, a weekly newspaper distributed in the Davis, California area led by UC Davis students. 
                The article will be coming out soon in Spring Quarter.</p>

            <p>Something Iâ€™ve gotten more comfortable doing is reaching out for help and putting myself out there. I reached out to Product Designer, 
                <a href = "https://twitter.com/round?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Maxim Leyzerovich</a> and met via Zoom about tips and advice for reaching out/ promoting a product from the ground up.</p>

            <p>Lastly, upon walking in San Francisco, I spotted local news reporter, Amber Lee and seized the opportunity and showed her 
            Find My COVID Test, demoing the website in hopes she would do a segment on my project. </p>

            <h2>Week 7 | Meeting Others</h2>

            <p>A slower week than normal, I continued to reach out to people on LInkedIn and email and update the testing map. </p>

            <p>I met with Catherine Yeo, a student who made <a href = "https://www.producthunt.com/posts/covid-vaccines-info-guide">
            COVID Vaccines Info Guide</a>, a COVID Vaccine website that informs users on the current COVID Vaccine Phase in their state. 
            It was my first time meeting someone else who had created a COVID related application, 
            but was wonderful to meet and learn more about her project. </p>

            <p>I met with ACUSD President, Kyle Kruger who will be helping me promote Find My COVID Test to the students at UC Davis!</p>
 
            <p>Additionally, I reached out to Healthy Davis Together, Davisâ€™s local COVID testing organization.</p>
                 
            <p>The 100+ LinkedIn invites I sent to various employees at testing organizations paid off. 
                I received a response from Jennifer B., an employee at Verily who sent it out to her coworkers.</p>
                 
            <p>As I continued to wait for a response from other LinkedIn members I had reached out to, 
                I followed up with people who accepted my invitations in hopes that I could schedule a meeting and 
                get insight to the COVID testing locations of their organization/ work together. </p>

            <h2>Week 9 | Project Baseline, Healthy Davis Together, and Curative</h2>

            <p>Monday, March 1, 2021, I received an email from Casimir S., the Head of Verilyâ€™s Project Baseline with a JSON file providing all 
                1200+ Verily testing locations in the United States. I have now added all of the West Coast locations Project Baseline operates.</p>
             
            <p>I decided to look back at the US Governmentâ€™s <a href = "https://covid-19-giscorps.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/giscorps-covid-19-testing-locations-in-the-united-states-symbolized-by-test-type/geoservice?geometry=-175.527%2C-88.408%2C62.129%2C88.467&showData=true">
                ARCGIS Database</a> of COVID testing locations in the United States and added 1,000 new COVID testing locations from Walgreens, CVS, AltaMed, Quest Diagnostics, Carbon Health, and Rite Aid.
    
            <p>During my weekly COVID test at UC Davis, I presented and demoed Find My COVID Test to the Healthy Davis Together team in hopes of working together.</p> 
        
            <p> I created a <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/@kwongenterprises/video/6935213454613630213?referer_video_id=6935213454613630213&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1">
                TikTok</a> that created a huge boost in page views of Find My COVID Test. </p>

            <p> Excitingly, I got in contact with the CEO of Curative and am currently working with them to get a full list of COVID testing locations they operate.</p>
                
            <p> Lastly, I onboarded my friend <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/jolifishi/">Joli Chien</a>, who is volunteering to help make graphics for the <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/findmycovidtest/">social media accounts</a>.</p>

            <p>In the last week of my independent study, I met with 
                Vinal Chand, Associate Vice President External Communications
                of ASUCD who will be helping me promote Find My COVID Test when we return from Spring Break.

            <p>Additionally, Iâ€™ve been in contact with Dr. Schorzman, Medical Director at UC Davis.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, Iâ€™ve spent most of my time working on this website to present the work I've done this independent study.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <p>The last 10 weeks have been a crazy journey. It's allowed me to learn and grow more than I could have ever imagined. This was truly an experience
                I don't think I could have had elsewhere.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest challenges I had creating Find My COVID Test was finding a reliable way of finding testing centers. 10 weeks later, I'm now working with 2 of the biggest COVID-19 testing organizations in the United States.
                It's unbelievable how far I've come and I'm so happy about the progress I've made.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I've been able to gain more traction on my website and learn new ways of promotion through social media outreach and how to professionally connect with people.</p>

            <h3>Thank you</h3>
            <p>A massive thank you to Professor Tom Maiorana for being my advisor during this independent study and for 
                all the support and advice you've given me.    
            </p>
